In order to feed today's global population, we currently need farmland equivalent to the size of South America. Despite the exorbitant amount of land already allocated to agriculture, an estimated 815 million people worldwide still go to bed hungry each night. Moreover, the worldwide population is estimated to be 9 billion by the end of 2050. Modern-day cities in the world already contain half of the world's population, which follows that the impact of the projected surge in global population will drastically decrease the amount of habitable land to extreme levels in order to maintain modern infrastructure.

The Urban-Bowl is a decentralised urban agricultural platform where people could rent vacant spaces such as backyards or basements to produce crops using vertical farming methods. Our incentives the urban population to farm by giving them a designated marketplace to sell their new product to consumers in their areas. We also provide our low cost modern IoT equipment and service for vertical farming techniques. We are very focused on the impact factor and our product meets the following UN Development Goals:

Goal 2: End Hunger  
Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities  
Goal 15: Reduction in forest loss and land degradation  
Goal 13: Climate Action  
Goal 12: Sustainable production pattern
