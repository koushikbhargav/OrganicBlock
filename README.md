In order to feed today's global population, we currently need farmland equivalent to the size of South America. Despite the exorbitant amount of land already allocated to agriculture, an estimated 815 million people worldwide still go to bed hungry each night. Moreover, the worldwide population is estimated to be 9 billion by the end of 2050. Modern-day cities in the world already contain half of the world's population, which follows that the impact of the projected surge in global population will drastically decrease the amount of habitable land to extreme levels in order to maintain modern infrastructure.
