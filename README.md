# UrbanBowl

The problem UrbanBowl solves :

In order to feed today's global population, we currently need farmland equivalent to the size of South America. Despite the exorbitant amount of land already allocated to agriculture, an estimated 815 million people worldwide still go to bed hungry each night. Moreover, the worldwide population is estimated to be 9 billion by the end of 2050. Modern-day cities in the world already contain half of the world's population, which follows that the impact of the projected surge in global population will drastically decrease the amount of habitable land to extreme levels in order to maintain modern infrastructure.
The UrbanBowl is a decentralized urban agricultural platform where people could rent vacant spaces such as backyards or basements to produce crops using vertical farming methods. Our incentives the urban population to farm by giving them a designated marketplace to sell their new product to consumers in their areas. We also provide our low cost modern IoT equipment and service for vertical farming techniques. We are very focused on the impact factor and our product meets the following UN Development Goals:

Goal 2: End Hunger Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities Goal 15: Reduction in forest loss and land degradation Goal 13: Climate Action Goal 12: Sustainable production pattern

Challenges we ran into :

As this was a Pitchathon we were more interested in developing the feasibility of our platform with the Indian markets. Hence we analyzed a lot of issues regarding renting guidelines and also the authenticity of crops. As the crops in the market place are grown through our platform, this can ensure the authenticity of every produce with the help of the underlying Blockchain Architecture. Also the recent ban uplift in India can also unveil the potential opportunities with crypto based payments. Our project is a web3 application built with Vue.js (2.6). We have built our Blockhain Architecture over Matic Networks Plasma Framework. This was primarily to scale our applications for the Indian markets and traffic. We also integrated crypto based payments from Matic Netowrk.

We are now running an pre-alpha pilot for our android based app. Please visit the website below to register.
